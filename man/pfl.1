This is the PFL upload script. The purpose of this script is to collect the
file names (not the content) of all installed packages from the Gentoo repo
and upload them to portagefilelist.de. After some time your uploaded data will
be imported into a searchable database. Thus you will provide a way for other
people to find a package which contains a specific file/binary. Please visit
https://www.portagefilelist.de for further information.
